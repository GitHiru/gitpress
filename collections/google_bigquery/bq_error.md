Query exceeded resource limits. This query used 96791 CPU seconds but would charge only 170M Analysis bytes. 
This exceeds the ratio supported by the on-demand pricing model. 
Please consider moving this workload to the flat-rate reservation pricing model, which does not have this limit. 
96791 CPU seconds were used, and this query must use less than 43500 CPU seconds.
